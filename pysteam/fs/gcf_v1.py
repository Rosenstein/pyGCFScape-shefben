"""Utilities for generating legacy v1 GCF structures.

This module adapts the structure building logic from the
``v1GCF_creator`` project by shefben which faithfully recreates the
behaviour of the 2002/2003 era Steam cache generators.  The original
tool emits the manifest and copy tables as standalone files.  We reuse
the same layout rules here so that :mod:`pysteam` can emit a single
GCF container that matches the legacy format.

Only the pieces that differ from the later GCF revisions are exposed â€“
namely the manifest header layout, sequential file identifiers and the
minimum-footprint copy table.  The rest of the conversion pipeline is
handled by :meth:`pysteam.fs.cachefile.CacheFile.convert_version`.

    The procedure mirrors the logic from ``threaded_manifest_generator``:

    * Manifest header version is ``3`` and ``DepotInfo`` remains ``2``.
    * Files receive sequential ``FileID`` values (``checksum_index``).
    * The copy table lists minimum-footprint files; if none are marked we
      fall back to listing every file, matching the reference tool.
    * Hash tables consist of a single bucket that chains every node,
      identical to the legacy manifests emitted by the original tool.
    * Per-file flags are synchronised with the copy table so that
      minimum-footprint entries always carry ``FLAG_IS_PURGE_FILE``.
