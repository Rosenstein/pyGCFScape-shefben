This tool is a GCFScape clone written in python.<br>
it can open newer version GCF files.<br>
it can preview hl and hl2 BSP files as wireframe mesh that is rotateable and zoomable.  zoom uses the mouse wheel, rotation uses click and drag or arrows.<br>
it can preview most image types.<br>
goldsrc and source engine MDL support is preliminary and untested, was not working last time i checked.<br>
the preview pane is dockable.<br>
it supports v1 GCF files.<br>
it is built ontop of a modified pysteam, so thank you pysteam maintainers.<br>
<br>
<br>
